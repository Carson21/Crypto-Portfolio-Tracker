Tracks your cryptocurrency portfolio

This is the first project that I am sharing publicly and this specific project helped me learn a lot about react, tailwindcss, using LocalStorage, web apis, and third party api's.

I ran into a lot of problems during the development of this project, such as the dumb mistake of wondering why the ui wasn't rerendering when I appended a value to an array. This is because react doesn't check to see if the contents of a reference changed, so when using objects and arrays in state, you have to do some clever tricks to get around this. I ran into other bugs along the way which helped me learn and get better at all the things involved with developing a web application.
